 Backend APIs for admin, teacher and student

To start the backend server :
1. Clone the repo.
2. Change the mongo uri in db.js
3. Install all the dependencies first using "npm i".
4. Run the server using "nodemon index.js".
5. I have included postman file "Postman testing api.json" in directory also, import it in postman.
6. First of all create admin account in mongodb "users" collection.
7. Now, use the login api to get auth token, then call the further APIs.

**I have also included the examples of different responses in postman file. Please check that also.**
